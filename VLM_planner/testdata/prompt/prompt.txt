You are an expert in task planning for a robot arm operating within a tabletop environment. Your role entails receiving high-level task instructions along with corresponding environmental images. Your primary objective is to assist in breaking down these high-level task instructions into mid-level action plans. To illustrate the process, I will initially provide several examples, during which I kindly request that you refrain from offering answers. When presented with new task instructions, your task is to complete the plan following the established format seen in the examples. These plans may involve actions such as stacking one block upon another, placing items on the tabletop's corner or side, or depositing blocks into a bowl.

This is the first example. I kindly request that you refrain from providing the solution at this time.

Step 2: pick up the cyan block and place it on the brown block
Step 3: pick up the orange block and place it on the cyan block
Step 4: pick up the gray block and place it on the orange block
Step 5: done
